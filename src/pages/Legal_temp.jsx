      <h2>0. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Contact us, email: <strong>s1nd4id2nsad4u4t2kdhj0qnav4lf@proton.me</strong>

      <p>
        Please read the TOS prior to contacting us.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Too many requests have been made to delete reviews that the user regretted making. We were lenient in removing these at first, but from now on, we will only remove reviews that go against guidelines. Otherwise, you will be required to claim the account and take it down yourself. Future requests like this will be ignored.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This policy is issued by GauchoGirls.com, referred to herein as "we," "us," "GauchoGirls," or "our."
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to GauchoGirls.com, a platform that revolutionizes dating in Isla Vista by putting the power back in women's hands. Our platform offers an anonymous experience for women to share insights about Isla Vista men to stay safe, do proper research, and share their experiences with others. By using our services, you agree to abide by the following Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the platform. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time, so please review them periodically.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Protocol to Report a Review</h2>
      <p>
        State the name of the profile, the review #, and which guideline is being breached. Decisions are largely determined by GPT. If you do not receive a response in 10 days, it is likely that the review did not breach the guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Not Subject to GDPR or CPRA</h2>
      <p>
        We are NOT subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as we do not operate within the European Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are NOT subject to the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), as we do not meet the following criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not have gross annual revenue of over $25 million.</li>
        <li>We do not buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents or households.</li>
        <li>We do not derive 50% or more of our revenue from selling personal information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. No Affiliation with UCSB</h2>
      <p>
        GauchoGirls is not affiliated with the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The use of the term "Gaucho" refers to the traditional Argentinian horseman and is not related to the university.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Legal Precedents</h2>
      <p>
        We draw inspiration from platforms such as the Lulu app, which allowed women to rate men anonymously, and RateMyProfessor, which allows students to leave reviews without mandatory sign-ins.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Clause Against Doxxing</h2>
      <p>
        We take doxxing seriously. Users are prohibited from exposing personal identifying information in reviews or on profiles.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Community Guidelines: Speech and Unprotected Speech</h2>
      <p>
        We respect your right to free speech. However, reviews that include unprotected speech or are flagged for defamation risk will be removed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Illegally threaten or illegally harass any individual.</li>
        <li>Share personal identifying information (PII).</li>
        <li>Defame or spread false information.</li>
        <li>Publicly disclose deeply personal private facts (even if true), unless related to criminal activity or public behavior.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you believe that a review violates the guidelines, report it via the email at the top of this page.
      </p>

      <h2>8. CalOPPA Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        We collect the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP addresses are stored.</li>
        <li>Emails and names from Google Sign-In are stored.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data will not be shared or sold to third parties but may be disclosed to government officials if required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Review Removal and Account Claiming</h2>
      <p>
        Users who wish to remove reviews that violate guidelines may request a free review removal. Alternatively, users may pay to claim their account, which grants the ability to remove any review.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
